# How to use the ticket system



## Getting Started Using Rcon Hexx Tickets!

Now that you either changed the server prefix or kept it the same. you can now participate in the next step. using Hexx Tickets

```markup
First you will need a tickets category for all the tickets!
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Note: if you ever delete the category by accident you can redo the setup process witch only takes 10-15 seconds!
{% endhint %}

How to start setup:

```markup
<prefix>setup
```

once it asks you for your category id send it within 30 seconds before the setup just quits on you and you will have to do the setup again.



How to create a new ticket:

```markup
<prefix>new
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: in the next update we will add custom ticket messages. and ticket subjects so please be patient.
{% endhint %}

How to close a ticket:

```markup
<prefix>close
```

And that's it for the ticket system!
