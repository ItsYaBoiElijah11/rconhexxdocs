## Question: Why are some of the commands on the premium/admin list not working?

**Answer**: Well it could be because of a update we made here at Team Hexx and we did not put it through enough testing before releasing the commands. if you ever find this kind of bug first join the support server \(Click Me\)\[https://smartt.link/hexx\] then tell us about it in the chats or in the dms of a bot developer or owner.
