# Why is hexx premium so cheap

## Question: Why is hexx premium so cheap

**Answer**: well I made hexx premium so cheap on purpose it was not by accident. I thought if I made it $1 USD then more people would use Hexx and think about buying it of course I don't really care if people do or don't buy it. its a really good deal though its x4 premium servers aka 25 Cents per server. and for it having a new feature or bug fix or even a early access command on it. and all the money goes into Rcon Hexx's development.
